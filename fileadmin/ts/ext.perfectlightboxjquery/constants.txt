	# Enable globally?: You can set this to on when you want to use the lightbox/slimbox as a general exchange for the standard popup-script. This way you get a lightbox for every image marked with "Click-enlarge". If more than one image is existent it's automatically an imageset. Of course you don't lose the other options (if set), they are still taken into account!
